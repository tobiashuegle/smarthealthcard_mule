Overview
SMART Health Cards are portable paper or digital versions of clinical information, such as vaccination history or test results. They allow consumers to keep a copy of a medical record on hand and easily share this information with others in an interoperable format when required. The initiative is part of the SMART Health IT program, an open standards and technologies initiative supported by all major healthcare IT and technology companies and now a requirement for interoperability as part of the 21st Century Cures Act in the US.

*This blog describes* the basic concept of SMART Health IT cards and how to implement them using the MuleSoft Anypoint platform. It will provide a sample implementation and document how to adapt it to accelerate SMART Health Card implementations with MuleSoftâ€™s AnyPoint Platform.


#How SMART Health Cards work
Government agencies and healthcare organizations can issue SMART Health Cards to their clients in much the same way they would previously have issued paper certificates for vaccination or test results. However, SMART Health Cards are much more portable as they can be added to digital wallets and for example submitted during a flight booking through APIs. They are also much more secure as they use state of the art digital signatures based on similar cryptographic techniques used in Bitcoin.
